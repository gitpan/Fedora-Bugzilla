As of Sat Jan 24 12:02:26 PST 2009, our xml attachment snippet looks like:

<attachment isobsolete="0" ispatch="0" isprivate="0">
    <attachid>320125</attachid>
    <date>2008-10-11 19:45 EDT</date>
    <desc>the great fedora-release!</desc>
    <filename>fedora-release</filename>
    <type>text/plain</type>
    <size>27</size>
    <attacher>cweyl@alumni.drew.edu</attacher>
    <data encoding="base64">RmVkb3JhIHJlbGVhc2UgOSAoU3VscGh1cikK</data>
</attachment>

FIXME -- we should deal with attachment flags, too!

=head1 NAME

Fedora::Bugzilla::Bug::Attachment - A bug attachment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a bug attachment, and provides various methods to
manipulate its data.  Right now, we don't support making any modifications to
the attachment (e.g. marking obsolete).

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<bug>

Our parent bug.

=item B<number>

The id of the attachment relative to the bug (e.g. this is attachment number()
of 13,000).

=item B<id>

=item B<date>

=item B<desc>

=item B<filename>


=item B<size>

=item B<type>

=item B<attacher>

=item B<is_obsolete>

=item B<is_patch>

=item B<is_private>

=item B<data>

=item B<raw_data> 

=item B<encoding>

=item B<as_string>

This class stringifies to its id().

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

We'll complain loudly and die on a non-existant attachment.

We will also complain loudly if the data decoding process fails for whatever
reason.  See L<MIME::Base64> for more details.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Fedora::Bugzilla::Bug>, L<Fedora::Bugzilla>.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Right now, we don't support any methods to change an attachment (status, etc),
neither do we provide an easy way of getting at the flags that may be
associated with the attachment.

=head1 BUGS 

See L<Fedora::Bugzilla>.
