=head1 NAME

Fedora::Bugzilla::Bug::NewAttachment - Define the paramaters needed to create an attachment

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use <Module::Name>;
	# Brief but working code example(s) here showing the most common usage(s)

	# This section will be as far as many users bother reading
	# so make it as educational and exemplary as possible.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

A full description of the module and its features.
May include numerous subsections (i.e. =head2, =head3, etc.)


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

A separate section listing the public components of the module's interface.
These normally consist of either subroutines that may be exported, or methods
that may be called on objects belonging to the classes that the module provides.
Name the section accordingly.

In an object-oriented module, this section should begin with a sentence of the
form "An object of this class represents...", to give the reader a high-level
context to help them understand the methods that are subsequently described.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Fedora::Bugzilla::Bug>, L<Fedora::Bugzilla::Attachment>.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or (preferably) 
add the bug to the camelus ticket tracker at 
L<https://fedorahosted.org/camelus/newticket>.

Patches are welcome.
