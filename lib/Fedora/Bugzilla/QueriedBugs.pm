=head1 NAME

Fedora::Bugzilla::QueriedBugs - A set of bugs resulting from a query/search

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # from known #'s/aliases
    $bugs = $bz->bugs(123456, 789012, ...);

    # from a query
    $bugs = $bz->query(...);

    # ...

    print $bugs->count . " bugs found: $bugs";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a collection of bugs, either returned from a query or
pulled via get_bugs().


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new()

You'll never need to call this yourself, most likely. L<Fedora::Bugzilla>
tends to handle the messy bits for you.

=head2 raw()

The raw array ref of hashes returned.

=head2 sql()

The SQL Bugzilla executed to run this query.

=head2 as_string()

Stringifies.  The "" operator is also overloaded, so you can just use the
reference in a string context.

=head1 ACCESSORS

All accessors are r/o, and are pretty self-explanitory.

=over 4

=item B<bz>

A reference to the parent Fedora::Bugzilla instance.
