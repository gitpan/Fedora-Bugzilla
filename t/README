Pretty soon I'm going to refactor these into files that make sense.  Each test
file will exercise specific functionality, and have its tests broken out as
such:

First, we'll run tests that can be executed w/o access to bugzilla (if any).

Then, tests that require access, but don't make any modifications.  This will
require FB_TEST_USERID and _PASSWD be set (and set correctly!).

Then, tests that both require access and make changes.  This will require the
two above vars plus FB_TEST_MAKE_CHANGES set.  (This should help cut down the
number of changes we make, new bugs, new attachments, etc...)
